This is a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number.
We use Luhn's Algorithm for detecting if credit card number is a valid number. And then by definitions of each's format, we detect whether it is Amex,Visa or MasterCard.
