This is problem set3. It is similar to plurality but this time we are deciding the winner of election via another kind of voting system known as a ranked-choice voting system(aka tideman). This problem has several functions for us to complete and some of them were really challenging. I had to google some concepts to really understand the problem.<br>
I used structs, 2d arrays, sorting algorithms, recursion and several other concepts that i learned in cs50 week3 and prior.<br>
